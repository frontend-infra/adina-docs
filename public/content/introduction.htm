<p>
  Adina, stands for Adaptively Inlined Assets, is a set of extension files that seemlesly integrate into any
  Webpack/Rspack client-side rendering project and improve its performance in an unprecedented way.
  <br />
  It was born from my thorough research of CSR:
  <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering"
    >https://github.com/theninthsky/client-side-rendering</a
  >
</p>

<br />

<p>This is how a regular code splitted app without Adina behaves:</p>

/>

<br />
<br />

<p>
  We can see that the data request is only sent after the page is loaded, and that the page's scripts are requested only
  after the initial (main) script executes.
</p>

<br />

<p>
  Adina, when used to its fullest potential (using an edge worker), can split the bundle into many small pieces,
  comprised of its installed packages (vendors) and the pages themselves, and then inline only the requested page
  scripts in the document response, allowing the app to be fully visible incredibly fast and in a single roundtrip!

/>

<br />
<br />

<p>
  When the page is loaded again, only missing assets will be injected (inlined) into the document.
  <br />
  If no assets are missing, the edge worker will respond with a <em>304 Not Modified</em> status code, and no addional
  data will be used:

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  This Rspack configuration is responsible of splitting vendors and async vendors to separate chunks and injecting them
  to a service worker for later precaching.

<h3>Detailed Breakdown</h3>

<p>
  The <strong>output</strong> object is set to save all scripts files under a <strong>scripts</strong> folder.

  <br />

  The <strong>optimization</strong> object is set to split venders and async vendors to separate chunks while preventing
  duplications. Each vendor chunk is given its package name, while async vendor chunksare given their package name in
  addition to all the async chunks that use them.
  <br />
  We set a lower 10kb limit for chunks to be split.

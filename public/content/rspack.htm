<h2>Overview</h2>
This Rspack configuration is responsible of splitting vendors and async vendors to separate chunks and injecting them to a service worker for later precaching.

<code>INJECTED_CODE</code>

<h2>In-Depth Analysis</h2>
The <strong>output</strong> object is set to save all script files under a <strong>scripts</strong> folder.

The <strong>optimization</strong> object is set to split venders and async vendors to separate chunks while preventing duplications.
During the optimization process, each vendor chunk is given its package name in addition to all the chunks that use it.

For example:
<em>
react.main.e2c127.js
react-router.main.b47e33.js
tanstack.products.cart.report.14f327.js
</em>
We set a lower 10kb limit for chunks to be split.
